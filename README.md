# Avorion-deployed

Recommended: Create a copy of your game files before making any changes, so that you can revert any mistakes without having to download the game again (although this is fine as the game is quite tiny to start with)

Instructions:
1. go to where your game files are located. on the root folder, you should see a sub folder called "data". if so you are in the correct location (DO NOT ENTER DATA)

2. download the zip, and inside there should be a mods folder and data folder. simply copy those to the root of the game files. this will overwrite certain files in your data folder. this is okay.

3. ask Piggu for the password :3

4. start the game, and search under multiplayer server (there is filter at the bottom) for "Piggu and Friends"
